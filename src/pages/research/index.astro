					My research investigates algebraic structures and their geometric manifestations, with an eye toward questions motivated
					by representation theory and secure communication. I am especially interested in the behavior of algebraic groups and
					monoids, geometric representation theory, and algebraic methods for coding theory.
				</p>

				<h2>Current areas</h2>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Algebraic groups and monoids:</strong> structure, classification, compactifications, and invariant theory.</li>
					<li><strong>Representation theory:</strong> unitary representations, harmonic analysis, and categorical approaches.</li>
					<li><strong>Algebraic geometry:</strong> birational techniques and singularities with applications to representation theory.</li>
					<li><strong>Error-correcting codes and security:</strong> algebraic and geometric constructions for robust communication.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Collaborations & lab</h2>
				<p>
					I lead the QSPARC Lab, a laboratory at Tulane University focused on algebraic approaches to secure communication and
					coding theory. The lab pairs theoretical research with experimentation, including work with SDR radios and post-quantum
					protocols.
