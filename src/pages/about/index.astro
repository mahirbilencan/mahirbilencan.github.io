					I am a professor of mathematics at {site.affiliation}. My work spans algebraic groups and monoids, representation theory,
					algebraic geometry, and the mathematics of secure communication. I am interested in how algebraic structure clarifies
					complex systems—whether in geometry, number theory, or coding theory.
				</p>

				<h2>Research</h2>
				<p>
					Recent projects include geometric approaches to representation theory, classification problems for algebraic monoids, and
					algebraic constructions for error-correcting codes. For additional details, see the <a href="/research/">Research</a> page
					or my <a href="/CV.pdf">CV</a>.
				</p>

				<h2>Teaching & mentorship</h2>
				<p>
					I teach undergraduate and graduate courses in analysis, algebra, and geometry, and I regularly supervise PhD students and
					undergraduate researchers. Current teaching information is posted on Canvas for enrolled students; a summary of recent
					courses lives on the <a href="/teaching/">Teaching</a> page.
